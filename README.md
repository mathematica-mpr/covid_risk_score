# DockerShinyApp

## Installing
This project is built to use Docker and docker-compose to make development easy across all machines and remove host machine configuration as a potential issue.  Use `docker-compose` to get started quickly.  You will need to install docker and docker-compose. 

* [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/)
* [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

Use docker-compose to build the image:
```
docker-compose build
```

Remember that docker images are immutable once built.  Only changes to files in `/home/rstudio` will persist after restarts. 

## Development
To create an RStudio environment preloaded with all dependencies
1. Create a `.env` file that defines the desired RStudio password, e.g.
```
PASSWORD=mystrongpassword
```
There is an example [sample.env](sample.env) you can also use.  Copy it and rename it to `.env`. 

2. Generate username and API key for USPS ZIP CODE CROSSWALK [here](https://www.huduser.gov/portal/dataset/uspszip-api.html). We will use this to look up the FIPS county code for the zip code submitted by the user. Add API key to doc/HUD_API_KEY.txt

3. Start the environment
`docker-compose up`

4. Visit `http://localhost:8787` and start hacking.

5. Keep shiny app code in `app.R`.  Launch it for development with `shiny::runApp('app.R')`.

## Deployment
Utilize the attached Dockerfile for a simple but efficient deployment setup.
